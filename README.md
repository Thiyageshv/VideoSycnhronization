Thiyagesh Viswanathan - Sycn using NTP clock (method 2)
Jerry A Barona  - Sync using rtpjitterbuffer and rtpbin (method 1 and part of method 2)
Rishikanth Chandrasekaran - Sync using Net clock  and plugin to calculate relative latency 

The proejct has various sender and receiver pipleines that we tried for various methods.
